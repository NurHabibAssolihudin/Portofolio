            <p>
                I am a software engineer, and one of my specialties is frontend web development. For me the "Front-end" part of the website is very important, because this is something that will be seen and felt directly by users. Efficiency is the main thing that I apply in every website I create, I also prioritize the simplicity aspect in my website design, so as not to make users confused with the existing features, not to forget I also like to experiment with javascript to make the website more responsive and look more attractive.
